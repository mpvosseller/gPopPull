# gPopPull
A Google Chrome extension that forces GMail to refresh email from connected POP3 accounts every 60 seconds.

As described in this [article](http://lifehacker.com/5346103/make-gmail-check-your-pop-accounts-more-frequently) you can configure GMail to fetch email from 3rd party email services via POP3. Unfortunately you cannot configure the frequency with which GMail should check for new mail. I have seen delays up to an hour.

This Google Chrome Extension will force GMail to check your POP3 accounts every 60 seconds. It also exposes a refresh button (in the URL bar) so you can force it to check immediately.

You can install this by downloading the .crx and dragging it on to the chrome://extensions page of Chrome.
